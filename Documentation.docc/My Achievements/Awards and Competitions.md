The awards I've received and competitions I've participated in

## Overview

During my secondary school years, I signed up for nearly every single competition that was available to me. I've always 
been interested in technology, I've always been competitive, and I've always wanted to prove myself. Over the years,
I've participated in more than 30 competitions, and won dozens of awards.

Technology as a category is a broad one, and the competitions I've participated in reflect that. They range from app 
development to <doc:Competitive-Programming-Competitions> to robotics and engineering. Aside from technology-related competitions, I have 
also won <doc:Academic-Awards> for my academic and school performance.

## Achievements

Certain competitions occur multiple times, but are mentioned once in the list below.
