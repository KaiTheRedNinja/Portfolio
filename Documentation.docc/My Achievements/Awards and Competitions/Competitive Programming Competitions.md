# Competitive Programming Competitions

Competitve Programming is a sport where participants solve algorithmic problems in a limited amount of time

## Perse Coding Team Challenge
The Perse Coding Team Challenge is a medium-difficulty competitive programming competition hosted by The Perse School, 
Cambridge. It consists of two rounds:
- The first round is a pair challenge, where teams of two students compete to solve algorithmic problems in a limited 
amount of time.
- The second round can be done individually or teams of 2 or 3, and is a more difficult set of problems with longer time.

I participated in the competition three times, for a total of 6 rounds. I won Gold in 2023, and Gold Top in School for 2024.

## National Olympiad in Informatics
The National Olympiad in Informatics is a competitive programming competition hosted by the National University of Singapore.
It is widely considered as one of the most difficult competitive programming competitions in Singapore.

I participated in the competition two times, and won Bronze for both 2023 and 2024.

## Australian Informatics Olympiad
The AIO is a 3-hour computer programming competition for students in years 7-12 (age 12-18). I participated twice and won
Bronze in 2022, and Gold in 2023.

## Bebras
The Bebras challenge is designed to help students explorer their talents and passion for informatics and computational 
thinking with engaging challenges. It is the precursor to Oxford University Computing Challenge.

I participated in Bebras once in 2022, where I won silver.

## Oxford University Computing Challenge
The Oxford University Computing Challenge aims to further develop students' skills and encourage them to produce programmed solutions to computational thinking problems.

The challenge begins with an online first round. The top 20 students in each category are invited to take part in 
a final round. This final round is conducted online on a single day in March under examination conditions.

I participated in both rounds and got Gold in 2022.

## Computational and Algorithmic Thinking
The Computational and Algorithmic Thinking (CAT) competition gives students the opportunity to develop their 
problem-solving skills through algorithmic thinking.

I participated in 2022.
