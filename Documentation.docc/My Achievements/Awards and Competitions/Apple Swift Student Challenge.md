# Apple Swift Student Challenge

The Swift Student Challenge is a challenge hosted by Apple for students to showcase their creativity and coding capabilities through Swift app playgrounds

## SSC 2024

My submission for the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2024 was <doc:Seymour-Fully-Digital> which is a fully digital version 
of <doc:Seymour> made for the <doc:SUTD-NP-SST-Big-D-Camp>. It uses sound instead of a grid of vibration motors to convey 
information.

I won the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2024 with this submission. I presented my project at the Apple Developer Center,
Singapore, on 20 June 2024. My submission was also featured on

## SSC 2023
My submission for the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2023 was Culture Speedrun, an app that explored the cultures of Vietnam,
Chengdu, and Bangkok, three areas that I had lived in during my childhood. Each country had a mini-game that showcased the 
aspect of the country's culture that most resonated with me.
- Vietnam: A game where you had to go through a maze to gather ingredients for Pho
- Chengdu: A crossy-road style game where a panda had to avoid obstacles to get to the bamboo
- Bangkok: A game where you had to visit temples and answer trivia about them
