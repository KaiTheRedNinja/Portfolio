# National STEM Championship

The National STEM Championship is a competition organised by the Science Centre Singapore, where students are tasked to solve real-world problems using STEM concepts

## Overview
The NSC is a televised show. We went through three rounds before being eliminated in the semi-finals.

### Round 1
This was a qualifications round. We made a catapult that could launch a ball the most accurately. We won this round.

### Round 2
This focused more on physics. There were challenges like identifying the density of a ball, or rotating a spring in
a certain manner.

### Round 3
This was a semifinal round. It was hosted at the Punggol Fire Station, where we programmed a robot to navigate a maze,
map it out, and locate "survivors". We competed against Nanyang Girls School, Global Indian International, and Raffles 
Institution. We lost to RI and did not proceed to the finals.
