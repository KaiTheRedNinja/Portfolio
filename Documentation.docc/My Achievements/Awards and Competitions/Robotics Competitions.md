Robotics competitions usually involve building a robot to complete several tasks or navigating around a course

## Overview
I participated in the following competitions:

## First Lego League Challenge
Robots built using Lego Spike move to different "stations" and solve tasks

## Purpose-Built Vehicle Competition
Hosted by Hyundai, this aimed to come up with concepts for the future of mobility and vehicles built to fit specific
purposes.

## RoboCupJunior Rescue Line U19
This was a one-day line tracing competition, where robots follow a map with lines as fast as possible.

## IDE Robotics Championship
Robots built using Lego Spike move to different "stations" and solve tasks

## National Robotics Competition
This is a research-based competition where teams build robots to solve a problem statement.
