# Academic Awards

The academic or school-based awards I've received, recognising academic or school achievements

## Yearly MOE ESIS award

The Edusave Scholarship for Independent Schools (Yearly Award) is awarded to Singaporean students in independent
shcools who are not awarded any other type of ESIS. These are given to the top 10% of each cohort by level in 
each IS based on their school examination results for the year. These awards are to encourage and reward students 
who have excelled academically as well as obtained a good grade for conduct in that year. I won this for 2022 and 2023.

## Edusave Certificate of Academic Achievement
Similar to the Yearly MOE ESIS award, but for the top 25%. I won this for 2022.

## SST Inventive Mind
The SST inventive mind award is an award given to students who turned innovative ideas into practical products 
that were implemented and solved existing problems. I won the SST Inventive Mind award in 2024 for <doc:ExiSST>,
which was used in the school's Model UN conference.

## SST CCA Outstanding Performance Award
The SST CCA Outstanding Performance Award serves to recognise deserving students who have shown outstanding 
performances while representing SST in competitions.

While I do not know what specifically I won this award for, I likely won it for my team's first place prize
in <doc:World-Robot-Olympiad-Singapore-Future-Innovators> in 2023.
