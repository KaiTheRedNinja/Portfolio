# Hack 'n' Roll

Hack 'n' Roll is an annual hackathon hosted by the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing, for secondary school to university students

## Overview

This was a two day overnight hackathon where participants form teams of up to 4 people to create a project from scratch,
without a theme.

My team created <doc:DecisionMaker>, and won the Best Pre-University Hack prize, which came with drawing tablets and airpods.

I missed the second day because I overworked myself on the first day and fell sick :(
