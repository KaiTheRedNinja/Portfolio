# ARTC-SIMTech-SST Innovation Camp

The ARTC-SIMTech-SST Innovation Camp was a hackathon in partnership with the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC), themed around recycling

## Overview

The ARTC-SIMTech-SST Innovation Camp was a 3-day hackathon where we were tasked with creating a solution to a problem in 
the recycling industry. My team created a solution that used the physical properties of different materials to sort them
automatically. We used a combination of passive processes and active detection of materials to seperate them. See
<doc:Automated-Recycled-Material-Sorter> for more details.

We were awarded the Design Excellence award for our project.
