The projects I've worked on that use both hardware and software

## Overview

Firmware projects here refers to projects that utilise both hardware and software. I've worked on a number of firmware projects, some
for school and others for competitions.

Out of all the projects I've done, these projects were the most challenging, and the most fun. They required a lot of problem solving and
interdisciplinary engineering knowledge, making use of electronics, programming, and even a bit of mechanical engineering.

My firmware projects have stretched my ability as an engineer and taught me various skills, both technical and non-technical.
