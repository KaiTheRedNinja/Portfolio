Sturrel is a gamified Chinese learning app for Singapore students, with vocabulary provided by Xuelin Learning Centre

## Overview

Sturrel was initially created for the Swift Accelerator Programme. It was later rewritten when I partnered with Xuelin 
Learning Centre to provide vocabulary for all Primary and Secondary year levels of Chinese. The iOS version is currently 
published on the app store, and the Android version is coming soon.

## Games

Students play games to learn Chinese vocabulary. The games are designed to be engaging and fun, while also helping students
to remember the vocabulary. They get the student to match between different "aspects" of vocabulary, namely
- The Chinese character itself, aka HanZi
- The Pinyin, which is the romanization of the Chinese character
- The English definition of the Chinese character

Currently, there are 4 games available:
- Drag and match, where students match the vocabulary aspects
- Memory cards, where students not only match the vocabulary aspects, but memorise their positions to do so
- Quiz, a regular multiple-choice-question type quiz
- Flashcards, where students go through a chapter's vocabulary using flashcard style revision

## Collaboration with Xuelin

I reached out to Xuelin Learning Centre in 2023 requesting their help in providing me with vocabulary. This ended up
resulting in a partnership between me and them, where I would get access to their vocabulary in exchange for adding
a search feature so that Xuelin teachers could use the app, and developing an Android version.

Sturrel was presented at the 2024 Xuelin teachers conference in Feburary 2024, and the Android version is scheduled to
release mid-2024.
