This app is designed in partnership with KKH Women's and Children's Hospital to help doctors and nurses in the Children's
Intensive Care Unit (CICU) easily access medical resources.

## Overview

For my Integrated Diploma Programme Capstone Project, I'm working with the KKH Women's and Children's Hospital to develop
a system that would help doctors and nurses in the Children's Intensive Care Unit (CICU) to access medical resources and 
drug dose calculations in a more efficient manner. This involves multiple user studies, interviews, and prototyping to 
ensure that the system is user-friendly and effective

## Site Visit and User Research

I visited the KKH Women's and Children's hospital in Febuary to get to know what issues the doctors and nurses are facing
with respect to accessing information. Their current system is a website with many layers of navigation, sometimes needing more than 6 clicks and hunting through vague menus to access a medical resource.

Our app's goal is to simplify the process into a mobile app, where the user is able to search for medical resources in an
efficient and easy-to-use manner. The doctors also requested we integrate a drug dose calculator into the app.

## App

The app itself has five features:
- View medical resource PDFs
- Search medical resources
- Bookmark/favourite medical resources (per-page, because these documents can be very long)
- Calculate drug doses
- Print out drug doses
