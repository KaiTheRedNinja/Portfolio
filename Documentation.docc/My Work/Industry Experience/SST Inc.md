SST Inc is an accelerator-type talent development programme that teaches students app development and exposes us to the tech and startup industry

## Overview

SST Inc is the App Development Talent Development Programme of the <doc:School-of-Science-and-Technology>, aiming incubate
a mini startup culture within the school, to create apps that benefit the community. Upon joining the programme in 
Secondary 1 at age 12, we go through a training programme by our seniors, who teach us various frameworks and languages to
create apps.

Afterwards, we embark on Project Serve, where we reach out to "clients" (both within and outside the school) to build apps
for them. The best apps produced during Project Serve are awarded the <doc:SST-Inc-App-of-the-Year>, and the teams are
given the opportunity to take part in <doc:Project-Sf>, where we go to San Francisco to learn about Silicon Valley startup 
culture.

## Project Serve

I made multiple apps for multiple clients during Project Serve. Some started out for fun and were later repurposed
for Project Serve.

<doc:Glassroom> was a personal project created out of frustration with Google Classroom. It uses a cache system to achieve
near instant load speeds, and a global search feature that allows searching across multiple classrooms. This app won the 
SST Inc App of the Year <doc:SST-Inc-App-of-the-Year#Champion-2023>

<doc:AttendINC> was initially created for SST Inc's internal attendance taking use. Later on, we took on the school's
leadership department as a client, and created <doc:ExiSST>. It was used for the Model United Nations conference, for which
my team won the <doc:Academic-Awards#SST-Inventive-Mind> award. This app won the SST Inc App of the Year 
<doc:SST-Inc-App-of-the-Year#1st-Runner-Up-2023>

<doc:MentalStop>, a one-stop mental health resource for teens and parents, was created for the 
<doc:Infocomm-Media-Club-Youth-Award>, where we were one of the top 6 teams, and went for the <doc:JPM-Work-Exposure>.
This app won the SST Inc App of the Year <doc:SST-Inc-App-of-the-Year#2nd-Runner-Up-2022>
