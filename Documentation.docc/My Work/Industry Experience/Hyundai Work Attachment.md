# Hyundai Work Attachment

The Hyundai Work Attachment was a 3-day programme where a group of students went to the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre (HMGICS), where we were given a tour of the facilities and participated in a design thinking and customer experience workshop. We learned about how customer experience is developed to maximise customer satisfaction
