The apps I've developed or worked on, for various purposes and platforms

## Overview

One of the aspects of engineering that I am very passionate about is software development. I've been programming since I was 12
and bored during the pandemic. I've developed a number of apps for various platforms, including iOS, Android, and macOS.

Application development to me represents a superpower: the ability to solve almost any issue you have. For example, I couldn't
stand the lack of a search feature and the slow loading speed of Google Classroom, so I made my own client for it, <doc:Glassroom>.
This problem solving aspect of app development is what I love the most.

I've worked on a number of apps for various purposes, including productivity, utility, and even healthcare. I started off app
development with <doc:SST-Inc> and later the <doc:Swift-Accelerator-Programme>, but almost all the skills I've cultivated to 
develop these apps were self-taught, by taking on projects and learning as I went along.
