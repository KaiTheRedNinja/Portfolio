PhotoBooth is my Secondary 4 Computing project. It is a photo booth written in python, which offered instagram-like filters with the theme of a school graduation

## Overview
My submission makes use of trigo functions to not only position filters at the right location, but also at the right rotation.
It includes the following filters:
- Sunglasses
- Gray wall
- Pond
- Excessive number of medals
