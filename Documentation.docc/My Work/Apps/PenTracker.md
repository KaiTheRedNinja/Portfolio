# PenTracker

PenTracker is my Secondary 3 Computing project, that tracks the end of a pen and translates it into cursor movement.

## Overview

PenTracker uses python object tracking to track a pen's tip, and used the tracking data to control the cursor. PenTracker
was designed to be a better art or Chinese input method.
