AuroraEditor is a native code editor for macOS, designed to be a lightweight and fast alternative to VSCode

## Overview

AuroraEditor was created by Nanashi Li and Wesley de Groot. I joined at an early stage, becoming a fellow project
manager.

It was created due to differences between AuroraEditor's founders and <doc:CodeEdit>'s management. I spearheaded 
multiple large refactors, such as the file system, version control, the editor, and fun features like vertical tabs.

Eventually, negotiations started to merge AuroraEditor back into CodeEdit. I rejoined CodeEdit as a maintainer.
