Announcer is an iOS and Android client for the SST Students Blog, developed in Swift and Flutter

## Overview

Announcer is a mobile app that allows students to view and interact with the SST Students Blog. The 
app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and modern interface. Announcer 
is available on both iOS and Android, and is built using Swift for iOS and Flutter for Android.

The student's blog has an outdated and user-hostile interface. Announcer aims to do what the
student blog was always meant to achieve: to allow students to access school related information 
on their own time.
