ElecCalculator is a tool to help students starting out with electronics with simple electronics formulas, 
resistor colour codes, and more

## Overview
I made this app to help me with me electronics work in Secondary 3. It was built in SwiftUI, and was designed
to be a simple, easy-to-use tool for students starting out with electronics.

I did not develop it further because many of the formulas become second nature to most electronics students
after a while, and I did not see a need to continue developing it.
