ExiSST is an adaptation of AttendINC, designed to take attendance on a school-wide level. It was used 
during the Model United Nations conference held in the School of Science and Technology (SST) in 2024

## Overview

ExiSST shares most of its behaviour with <doc:AttendINC>, but with a few key differences. It was adapted with
feedback from Mr Ng Goh Hui, the head of student leadership in the School of Science and Technology.

## Differences from AttendINC
There were several requirements that SST Inc. required for AttendINC that the school did not need for ExiSST.
Namely, the school had the following requirements:
- Log emails even if they aren't in the attendance list
- Simpler UI for teachers to use
- Admin and teacher roles
