The HobLearn is my Secondary 1 ChangeMakers project. It was designed to be a box that helps students find hobbies they might enjoy

## Overview

The HobLearn is a box that contains reusable objects that can serve as starting points for students to explore hobbies. The box
contains a microcontroller and a display, which shows the user how to use objects to get started with different hobbies.
