Seymour is a novel blind assistive device that conveys depth information to a visually impared user. Seymour won the Design Excellence Award in the SUTD-NP-SST Big D Camp 2024

## Overview

This project was created for the 3-day <doc:SUTD-NP-SST-Big-D-Camp>, where it won the Design Excellence award. I have
a high risk of retinal detachment, so when it was announced that the theme for the competition was accessible technology,
I used it to test out one of my wildest ideas: Seymour. 

Seymour relies on the Potato Head model of senses, proposed by American neuroscientist David Eagleman. It roughly
states that it doesn't matter how information gets to the brain, the brain will figure out how to deal with it. This
is comparable to how people don't need to consciously think about balancing on a bike - the brain automatically figures
it out for them.

Seymour uses AI to determine the depth of the environment, and conveys it to the user through a grid of vibration motors 
on the back of the user's neck. The user will initially need to interpret these vibrations consciously - A stronger 
vibration on the left meaning that there might be a wall to the left, for example. Eventually, the visually impared
user will be able to subconsiously interpret these, gaining a "sense of depth".

    Note: I am not a neuroscientist, and have not conducted any research on the senses and am using a rudimentary understanding
    of neuroscientific concepts. I have a surface-level understanding of these concepts and what they achieve, and am using
    that knowledge as an engineer, not a doctor, to create prototypes.

## Partnering with Companies

Seymour was used for the IDEX competition hosted by ACSI. A variation of Seymour, <doc:Seymour-Fully-Digital>, was created 
for and won the <doc:Apple-Swift-Student-Challenge#SSC-2024>.

I've reached out to IC2, a foundation aimed to help the visually impared with accessibility technology, to help bring this
project further and get feedback from actual visually impared users on it.
