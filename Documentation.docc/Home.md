## What Made Me

    - <doc:Global-Experience>
}

I've received a global education focused on applied learning, and have worked with 6 organisations and companies in the
technology and healthcare sector. I'm a fast learner, and always looking for ways to apply my skills in new and exciting 
ways.

## What I've Done

My interest in engineering covers both software and hardware. Since my first introduction to programming in 2020, I've
created several <doc:Firmware-Projects> and dozens of <doc:Apps>.

I was a part of my elementary school's robotics club, and often spent my time in the MakerSpace tinkering with electronics. 
When I returned to Singapore in 2024, I applied to my current school, the <doc:School-of-Science-and-Technology>. In 
Secondary 3, I took the Engineering course, and was even selected to represent it.

I'm particularly passionate about using technology for accessibility. I've needed glasses since 3 years old and I'm at
risk of retinal detachment, so I'm interested in using my engineering skills to improve the lives of those sometimes
overlooked during the progress of technology. During the <doc:SUTD-NP-SST-Big-D-Camp>, I created <doc:Seymour>, a firmware 
product making use of AI to deliver environmental information to a visually impared user.

Throughout my time in Secondary School, I have participated in over 30 competitions, and won dozens of 
<doc:Awards-and-Competitions>. For two years, I led <doc:SST-Inc>, my school's Talent Development Programme for app 
development. My passion for engineering has shaped nearly every aspect of my life.

## Where I want to go

I want to eventually work in the technology sector, helping to make technology a more human-centric experience. I'm very
inspired by [Kagi](https://kagi.com), a search engine company trying to "humanise the web" by coming up with new ways
to monetise without being privacy infringing. 

Being able to Human-centric technology, especially accessibility technology, is one of the ultimate missions of mine.
I've already taken steps towards it, like reaching out to companies to expand on my <doc:Seymour> project.

## Being a Holistic Human

}

I believe in being well rounded person, through leadership, volunteering, and having something in my life other than my
school and work. 

I've had some leadership capacity in most of the group projects I've been in, and I led <doc:SST-Inc> for two years. 
I occasionally volunteer at the <doc:Swift-Accelerator-Programme>, and in my free time I run or play volleyball.
