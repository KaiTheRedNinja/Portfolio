## My Passions and Aspirations

I'm highly passionate about engineering, both in software and hardware. I was a part of my elementary school's robotics
club, and often spent my time in the MakerSpace tinkering with electronics. When I returned to Singapore in 2024, I
applied to my current school, the <doc:School-of-Science-and-Technology>. In Secondary 3, I took the Engineering course,
and was even selected to represent it.

Throughout my time in Secondary School, I have participated in over 30 competitions, and won dozens of 
<doc:Awards-and-Competitions>. For two years, I led <doc:SST-Inc>, my school's Talent Development Programme for app 
development. My passion for engineering has shaped nearly every aspect of my life.

I developed a strong interest in accessibile technology, after receiving a diagnosis that I was at risk of retinal
detachment. During the <doc:SUTD-NP-SST-Big-D-Camp>, I created <doc:Seymour>, a firmware product making use of AI
and yap yap yap yap yap
