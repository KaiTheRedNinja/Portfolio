The global experiences I've had, and how they've shaped me as a person

## Overview

Throughout my childhood, I've lived in many places through out Asia. Having the opportunity to work with people from all over the world was
one of the most valuable gifts life has provided me. My global experience has contributed to my unique perspective and manner of solving
problems.

I primarily studied in Chengdu, China and Bangkok, Thailand during my Elementary school years, before moving back to Singapore during the Covid
pandemic. I was able to experience different cultures and learn about the world in a way that I would not have been able to otherwise.

I've also had the opportunity to participate in various exchange programmes, where I was able to learn about different cultures and work with
people from all over the world. These experiences have helped me grow as a person, and gain knowledge on an international scope.
