My leadership experience, what I've learned, and how I've grown

## Overview

I've led teams in various capacities throughout the <doc:Apps> and <doc:Firmware-Projects> I've worked on. Most
significantly, I led my school's App Development Talent Development Programme, <doc:SST-Inc>, for two years, where
I had to manage an executive committee of 12 students, and the Programme, with over 100 students. To effectively lead,
I had to develop my communication, organization, and problem-solving skills.
