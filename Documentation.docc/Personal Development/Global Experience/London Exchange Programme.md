The London Exchange Programme is a partnership between SST Singapore and Maidstone, UK

## Overview

We went to Maidstone, UK for a 2-week exchange programme. We stayed with host families, and attended classes at Maidstone 
Grammar School. We also visited London and Norwich.

## London
We arrived at London on the first day, and visited the Science, Natural History, and Design Museums on second day. We also
got to take the Tube.

We also went to University College London, where we attended a lecture on the use of technology in archaeology.

## Maidstone
At Maidstone, we attended classes with the SST students there. At the homestay, I got to experience the British culture and
lifestyle, by walking around the area, seeing local attractions like a church, and eating at a pub.

## Norwich
We went to Norwich for a day trip, where we visited the Norwich Castle museum and Greshum School. There, we got a tour of
the campus, took inspiration from their design projects, and took part in a computer science class. It ended with us riding
the zipline at the school.
