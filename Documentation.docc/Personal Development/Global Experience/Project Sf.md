Project SF is a biannual learning journey, where students are exposed to the startup culture of Silicon Valley

## Overview

At Project SF, we visited various companies, events, and toured the SF area, to learn more about SF and startup culture.

## Touring
We toured the San Francisco bay area on the first day, visiting the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, and Lombard Street

## Developer Week
Developer week was an event where startups show off their work in a gallery. We used this as a connection point to network 
with the companies.

One of the most memorable companies was one making keyboards, with unique controls on the side of the keyboard, where the
user would be able to slide their finger across the edge of the keyboard to control various functions.

## Fortinet
Fortinet is a company that specializes in cybersecurity. We visited their headquarters and learned about their products and
services. We were hosted by the Field CTO. 

They also explained how their headquarters was designed, to have maximum cooling capability and eco-friendlyness.

One of the most memorable things was the Field CTO's explanation about their use of generative AI. Since its extremely
hyped nowadays, it was interesting to see an experienced person's take on its use. Even though the Fortinet website says
it uses AI, he said that they actually only use it for customer support, where its used to generate responses to common
questions. I think that this is a good example of how AI should realistically be used in a company.

## Oracle
Oracle is a company that specializes in databases. We visited their headquarters and learned about their products and
services. We were hosted by the VP of Database Product Management, Jenny Tsai.

We also got to talk to two of their engineers. They talked about their journeys, how they came from China and did their
masters in the US, where they got hired by Oracle. They also talked about how they got to work on the Oracle database, and
stories about developing and teamwork.

Oracle goes with a one-manager-managing-many-teams system, where managers are usually both technical mentors and leaders. 
This is different from the one-manager-one-team system that I've seen in other companies, or the system where managers
only set goals and can't help with technical problems.

## Apple
At Apple, we talked to five Singaporean engineers. They worked in Hardware testing, Software development, and the camera
department. They talked about their journeys, how they came from Singapore and did their masters in the US, where they got
hired by Apple.

One story that stood out was the story of the engineer who worked on hardware testing. He said that he went to university
in Canada right after secondary school, skipping tertiary education in Singapore. This came as a large surprise to me, as
I had always thought that the Singaporean education system was very strict and that it was impossible to skip tertiary
education.

I bought two shirts from the Apple Store.

## Google
Google was highly locked down, and we couldn't visit many places. We were hosted by two Google engineers.

The most interesting thing I heard was Google's monorepo system. They have a single repository for all their code, which
they say is very efficient. They use a "code owners" system, where people must seek approval from the "owner" of a certain
part of the code before they can make changes to it.

## Ironclad
Ironclad is a startup that specializes in contract management. We visited their headquarters and learned about one of their
employees' journeys, how he came from SST and came to join Ironclad.

He shared an interesting method of thought that I really liked, which is outcome-based thinking. We were talking about issues
we faced in SST Inc, and he said that we should think about the outcome we want, and then work backwards from there.

Using that logic, he explained how our solutions for SST Inc's problems didn't actually resolve the issues.
