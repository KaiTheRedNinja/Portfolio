My regular and ad-hoc volunteer work, what I've learned, and how I've grown

## Overview

Volunteering is a way to give back to the community. I've mainly volunteered at the <doc:Swift-Accelerator-Programme>, where I help
teach students app development, as the volunteers before taught me. I've also participated in <doc:Park-Cleanup>s and two 
<doc:Robotics-Clubs-Girls-in-Stem-Challenge>s to help promote STEM education among girls.
